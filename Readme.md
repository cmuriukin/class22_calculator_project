1. Overview and Introduction: This Bash script performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) between two numbers entered by the user. It provides a simple command-line interface for mathematical calculations.
2. Input: The script prompts the user to input two numbers and then select an arithmetic operation from the displayed menu. The menu options are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
3. Operations: Based on the userâ€™s choice, the script computes the result of the selected operation using the bc utility for accurate mathematical calculations.
4. Division Handling: Special error handling is included for division operations to prevent division by zero, displaying an appropriate error message if the second number is zero.
5. Expected Output: After performing the selected operation, the script displays the result in a clear format, indicating the operation performed and the computed value.
6. Changes: The script can be easily extended by adding more operations or enhancing error handling for invalid inputs, making it a versatile tool for basic command-line calculations.
